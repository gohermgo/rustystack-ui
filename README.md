# rustystack-ui
the rustystack frontend, an ungodly amalgam of dioxus, html through macros, and formantic for ease of styling.
originally, it was based upon yew and tailwind, but solution was discarded basically at the start of development, for some very simple reasoning:
- it was annoying to install without getting javascript involved, and this should be as pure rust as possible (with only css and html to assist it)
- yew requires the nightly rust toolchain and i couldn't be bothered to get the rust-analyzer to work with macros in nightly
progress will likely be slow, maybe even stop for periods of time, but that's fine, this is a **passion project** first and foremost.
i love rust, i have minimal webdev experience, and as rust and rust-like languages crop up, this could be an exciting and active frontier to be exploring.
